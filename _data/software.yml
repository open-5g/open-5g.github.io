        OAI provides software-based implementations of LTE base stations (eNBs), UEs and EPC compliant with LTE Release 8.6 (with an additional subset of features from LTE Release 10). OAI source code is written in C to guarantee real-time performance, and is distributed under the OAI Public License, a modified version of the Apache License v2.0 that allows patent-owning individuals and companies to contribute to the OAI source code while keeping their patent rights. Both the eNB and UE implementations are compatible with Intel x86 architectures running the Ubuntu Linux operating system. (An experimental version for the CentOS 7 is under development.) Several kernel- and BIOS-level modifications are required for these implementations to achieve real-time performance, including installing a low-latency kernel, and disabling power management and CPU frequency scaling functionalities.

        srsRAN provides a suite of software comprising srsUE (4G LTE, 5G NSA), srsENB (4G LTE, 5G NSA), and srsEPC (4G EPC /MME,HSS,SPGW). 5G SA functionality (srsUE, srsGNB) is coming in 2022. It is compliant with LTE Release 10, with some features from higher versions, e.g., NR Release 15. The software suite is written in the C and C++ programming languages and it is distributed under the GNU AGPLv3 license. srsRAN is compatible with the Ubuntu and Fedora Linux distributions. It does not require any kernel- or BIOS-level modifications to achieve real-time performance though disabling CPU frequency scaling is recommended.

        Radisys is a 4G/5G vendor that contributes to a number of open source software consortia, including O-RAN and several Open Networking Foundation (ONF) initiatives.As part of O-RAN, Radisys provides an open source implementation of the 3GPP NR stack for the gNB DU. To date, does not represent a complete solution that can be deployed to run real-world experiments (as with OAI and srsRAN), as it lacks integration with open source CU and RU implementations. However, this represents a key first step toward the availability of an open source 5G gNB based on the CU/DU split principle. he currently available open source code provides a complete implementation of the MAC and RLC layers. The Radisys release also provides a layer that manages the operations of the DU and interfaces it with the CU, the RU and external controllers, when available. The codebase is aligned with Release 15 of the 3GPP NR specifications. The NR MAC uses the Functional  Application  Platform  Interface  (FAPI)  to interact with a scheduler, adapted from an LTE implementation. The RLC layer supports TM, UM, AM modes.

            Open5GS offers an open source implementation of a Release 16 4G/5G NSA compliant EPC, and a 5G SA core. The 4G/5G NSA network components and 5G SA network functions are written in C and  distributed under  the  AGPLv3  license. It  is  compatible  with  a variety of Linux distributions, such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and  CentOS, as well as FreeBSD and macOS. Differently from  other EPCs, Open5GS supports the delivery of voice calls and text messages through the LTE network instead of relying on traditional circuit switching networks. This is achieved by leveraging third party Voice over LTE (VoLTE) and SG-SMS (SMSoSGs) solutions, respectively; such as those from Kamailio and Osmocom. Open5GS includes PCRF/PCF modules, through which operators can specify network policies in real-time, including prioritizing a certain type of traffic. Advanced 5G SA core functionalities, such as slicing, are currently under development. Open5GS is being used with a variety of 4G and 5G software stacks and physical radio equipment. A list of tested compatible equipment is available at https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/hardware/01-genodebs

            The O-RAN Alliance is an industry consortium that promotes the definition of an open standard for the vRAN, with two goals[4]. The first is the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques in the RAN, thanks to intelligent controllers deployed at the edge[78]. The second is the definition of an agile and open architecture, enabled by well-defined interfaces between the different elements of the RAN. Since all O-RAN components must expose the same APIs, it is easy to substitute components with others offering alternative implementations of the same functionalities. This allows O-RAN-based5G deployments to integrate elements from multiple vendors, thus opening the RAN market to third-party entities providing new functionalities and diversified services. Moreover, it makes it possible to adopt COTS hardware, in an effort to promote flexibility and reduce costs. Eventually, following the trend started with cloud-native infrastructures, the O-RAN Alliance also aims at promoting open source software as part of the consortium effort.

            COMAC is a platform that targets the integration of multiple access and CN technologies, including 4G and 5G cellular networks, broadband, fiber and cable networks, and Wi-Fi deployments. The framework provides a common data plane in the core, which aggregates user data to and from different access technologies, and the possibility of managing users’ subscriptions and identities with a single management platform. COMAC is based on the SEBA platform (a lightweight multi-access technology platform, which provides high-speed links from the edge of the network to the backbone of the infrastructure), and on multiple ONF Component Projects, such as OMEC, for the mobile core and edge, and CORD for the broadband subscriber management. Moreover, it will exploit O-RAN (with the SD-RAN implementation) for the control plane of the mobile cellular access.

            SD-RAN is an open source RAN framework that follows the O-RAN development by building and trialing
            O-RAN compliant open source components. In particular, SD-RAN is developing a cloud-native near-real-time RIC
            (nRT-RIC) and a set of exemplar xApps to control the RAN. This effort has a tight interplay with the other
            ONF frameworks, including COMAC, ONOS, and Aether.

            Aether streamlines the deployment of private enterprise cellular networks. It combines three main elements, namely,
            a control and orchestration interface to the RAN, an edge cloud platform (the Aether edge), with support
            for cloud computing APIs, and a central cloud (the Aether core), for orchestration and management.
            The Aether project will build and integrate several ONF efforts, including SD-RAN, ONOS, CORD and OMEC.
            At the time of this writing, the source code and the deployment pipeline are not publicly available.
            When the code will be released, besides providing an opportunity for private 5G networks,
            Aether could be effectively used to deploy and manage integrated RAN-edge testbeds for 5G research
            and innovation.

            Magma is a framework developed by the Facebook Connectivity initiative for simplifying the
            deployment of cellular networks in rural markets. Notably, its goal is to avoid dependence on a
            specific access technology (i.e., cellular or Wi-Fi) or on a generation of 3GPP core networks.
            Moreover, it avoids vendor lock-in for telecom operators, while offering advanced automation and
            federation capabilities. The latter is particularly relevant in rural and under-developed scenarios,
            as it allows the pooling of resources from multiple network operators. Magma is composed by three components,
            i.e., an access gateway, to interface RAN and core networks; a cloud-based orchestrator, for control; and
            a federation gateway, which can be used to bind together multiple core networks.

            source and reprogrammable software platform abstracting the physical RAN infrastructure and providing
            high-level APIs to control RAN functionalities.
            5G-EmPOWER currently supports several mobile Radio Access Technologies (RATs) such as LTE via srsRAN,
            Wi-Fi, and LoRa. The 5G NR is not supported yet. Integration of diverse RATs is obtained through
            agents embedding specialized wrappers, one for each RAT. While the general architecture of the
            agent is RAT-independent, the wrapper is RAT-specific. For instance, new RATs (e.g., 5G NR) can
            be integrated by implementing new wrappers.

            FlexRAN leverages abstraction and softwarization technologies to develop a RAT-independent RAN
            management platform. FlexRAN embraces SDN principles to decouple control and data planes.
            The control plane is orchestrated by a real-time centralized controller, which controls a
            set of agents, one for each network element. FlexRAN implements a set of REST APIs in JSON
            format describing the northbound interface of FlexRAN. These APIs are used by the agents to
            interface with base stations, thus enabling control of the protocol stack and functionalities
            of the base stations (i.e., MAC, RRC, PDCP).

            The CORD framework is based on multiple software solutions that, together with reference hardware design, realize a reference MEC architecture based on SDN, NFV and cloud-native solutions. CORD aims at (i) reducing deployment costs by using commodity hardware, and (ii) enabling innovative services, thanks to well-defined APIs for accessing edge computing facilities and multi-domain security. Moreover, CORD can be easily extended to address the heterogeneous requirements of different markets. In particular, two CORD architectures specific for mobile and residential services have been spawned off into two Exemplar Platforms (SDN-Enabled Broadband Access (SEBA) and COMAC). CORD is one of the ONF projects with the largest number of contributions by the open source community. It includes detailed installation, operation and development guides, and a set of repositories with its source code.

        ONAP handles the design, creation, and life cycle management of a variety of network services. Network operators can use ONAP to orchestrate the physical and virtual infrastructure deployed in their networks, in a vendor-agnostic way. In addition to common NFV orchestrator functionalities (e.g.,automated policy-driven management of the virtualization infrastructure and of the network services), ONAP provides a design framework to model network applications and services as well as a framework for data analytics to monitor the services for healing and scaling. Additionally, ONAP provides a number of reference designs, i.e., blueprints. These can be used to deploy the ONAP architecture in specific markets or for specialized use cases (i.e., 5G networks or Voice over LTE deployments). They have been tested in combination with their typical hardware configurations.

        The OSM framework is an end-to-end network service orchestrator, tailored for deployment in mobile networks. OSM is in charge of provisioning network services, i.e., combinations of physical and virtual network functions that can be chained together with a specific topology, managing their creation and life-cycle. Notably, during the initialization of a network service, a basic configuration (0-day) is applied by default. Then, the MANO framework advertises the actual configuration for the function or service (1-day). Finally, updates (2-day configurations) can be deployed at a later stage. OSM is composed by an information model, to define the network functions and services, and an automation framework, to manage their life-cycle.
